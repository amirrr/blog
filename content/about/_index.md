My name is Amirhossein, but everyone calls me Amir. I earned my bachelor's degree in software engineering from Kharazmi University in Tehran. For my master's degree, I studied computational social science at RWTH University in Aachen, Germany.

In the professional realm, I have worked as a software and web developer for several years. Another one of my key interests is the study of social phenomena through observational data. I am fascinated by the power of data-driven insights in revealing hidden patterns, trends, and behaviors within society.

I am a developer and co-founder of the [Eranshahr](https://www.eranshahr.com/) project, where we aim to introduce people to Iranian culture and share the beauty of Iranian culture with the world.

Additionally, I collaborate with the [CSS lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania on various projects involving the study of people and the development of tools to assist researchers and practitioners.
