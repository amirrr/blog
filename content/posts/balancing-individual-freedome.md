### **Equality Theories Explored by Amartya Sen**

In his paper "Equality of What?" by Amartya Sen, he delves into three different conceptions of equality, examining their strengths and limitations while proposing an alternative formulation termed "basic capability equality." Sen presents this framework as a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to the concept of equality.

#### **I. Methodological Approaches to Critiquing Equality [217, 198]**
Sen begins by discussing two distinct methodological approaches, the case-implication critique and the prior-principle critique, to evaluate and analyze moral claims associated with different conceptions of equality.

#### **II. Critique of Rawlsian Equality [215]**
Exploring Rawlsian equality, Sen highlights its reliance on two principles of justice. While it prioritizes fundamental liberties and necessitates efficiency combined with equality, it permits inequalities only if they benefit the worst-off. Sen argues that despite addressing some limitations of utilitarian and total utility equality, Rawlsian equality falls short. He points out its potential oversight of the diverse needs of individuals, particularly those with disabilities or disadvantages.

**Hypothetical Scenario:** Sen uses the example of two workers to illustrate his critique of Rawlsian equality. Worker A, physically able, is compared with Worker B, who has a longstanding medical condition requiring substantial healthcare expenses. The Rawlsian model of equality, focusing on equal opportunities, income, and wealth (primary goods), overlooks the added struggles faced by Worker B due to their medical situation, creating considerable differences in their realistic capabilities.

#### **III. Proposal of Basic Capability Equality**
In response to the limitations identified in other equality models, Sen introduces the concept of basic capability equality. This approach emphasizes individuals' fundamental capabilities such as mobility, meeting nutritional requirements, and participation in social life. Sen advocates for a shift in focus from mere utility or primary goods towards what individuals can achieve, considering the diversity among people.

**Critiques and Responses:** Critics like Charles Gore question Sen's emphasis on individual effective freedom, highlighting its potential neglect of important social and communal values. Another critique pertains to the vagueness of Sen's emphasis on individual freedom and its societal impact, especially in balancing freedoms that might harm the broader society.

#### **IV. Sen's Conclusion**
Sen concludes that utilitarian equality, total utility equality, and Rawlsian equality exhibit limitations in providing a comprehensive theory of equality. He posits that basic capability equality stands out as a more inclusive and refined approach, considering the diversity among individuals and emphasizing their basic capabilities.
